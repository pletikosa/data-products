## MOTIVATION

<br/>

### PROBLEM

* Selling a house is <span style="color:#cc0000">ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL EVENTS</span> in life.

* It was found to be even more stressful than bankruptcy, divorce or loss of someone you love<sup>1</sup>. 

* With the housing market finally recovering, many people are looking to sell their homes.

* One way to avoid stress is to <span style="color:#cc0000">OFFER YOUR HOUSE AT A COMPETITIVE PRICE</span>.

</br>

<br/>

* <span style="color:#cc0000">HOUSE PRICE ESTIMATOR (HPE)</span> is an online platform which will help you estimate the value of your house on the market based on the following criteria:
  + Construction Year,
  + Number of Bedrooms,
  + House Size,
  + Lot Size,
  + Location, and
  + Month when you plan to sell.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

<br/>

* HPE builds its prediction model based on the <span style="color:#cc0000">nutshell::sanfrancisco.home.sales</span> dataset:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(nutshell)
data(sanfrancisco.home.sales)
str(sanfrancisco.home.sales)
```

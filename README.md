# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This repository contains the files required for the Data Products course project. The goal of the project was:

1. To create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers, and
2. To prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about this application.

The code used for the Shiny application can be found under: [https://github.com/pletikosa/data-products/tree/master/app](https://github.com/pletikosa/data-products/tree/master/app).

The application itself is available under: [https://pletikosa.shinyapps.io/project/](https://pletikosa.shinyapps.io/project/)

The code used for preparing the pitch presentation can be found under: [https://github.com/pletikosa/data-products/tree/master/presentation](https://github.com/pletikosa/data-products/tree/master/presentation).
